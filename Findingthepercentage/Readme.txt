Problem Statement

You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. The user enters some integer N followed by the names and marks for N students. You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.

Input Format

The first line contains the integer N, the number of students. The next N lines contains the name and marks obtained by that student separated by a space. The final line contains the name of a particular student previously listed.

Output Format

Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.

Constraints 
2 <= N <= 10 
0 <= Marks <= 100

Concept

A dictionary is a data type which stores values in pairs. For each element in the dictionary, there is a unique key that points to a value. A dictionary is mutable. It can be changed. 
For example:

>> a = {'one': 1} # Here 'one' is the key.  
Note: The key of a dictionary is immutable. We cannot use a list as a key because a list is mutable.

>> a['two'] = 2 # Adds key 'two' which points to 2
>> a['one']
1  
>> if ('three' in a):
      # To check whether a certain string exist as a key in the dictionary  
..    print a['three']
.. else:  
..    print "Three not there"
Three not there
>> del a['one']
# Deletes index 'one' and the value associated with it  
>> a
{'two': 2}
Note: A dictionary is unordered. So, only use the keys to navigate through the dictionary.
