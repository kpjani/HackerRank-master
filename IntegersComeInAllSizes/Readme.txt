Problem Statement

Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size as there is: 231-1 (c++ int) or 263-1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of ab grows really fast with increasing b.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task 
Read four numbers, a, b, c, and d, and print the result of ab+cd.

Input Format 
Integers a, b, c, and d are given on four separate lines, respectively.

Constraints 
1=a=1000 
1=b=1000 
1=c=1000 
1=d=1000

Output Format 
Print the result of ab+cd on one line.
