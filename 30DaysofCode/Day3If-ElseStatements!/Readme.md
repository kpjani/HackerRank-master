#**Problem Statement**

Welcome to Day 3! Check out a review of if-else statements here, or just jump right into the problem.

Using "if-else" you can perform decision making in your code. 

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

If N is odd, print "Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".
We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

#**Input Format**

There is a single line of input: integer N.

**Constraints**
1≤N≤100

#**Output Format**

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". Do not print the quotation marks.

**Sample Input 1**

3
**Sample Output 1**

Weird

**Explanation** 
N=3, is odd hence the its a Weird Number.

**Sample Input 2**

24
**Sample Output 2**

Not Weird

**Explanation**
N=24, is >20 hence its not a Weird Number.
