Problem Statement

Let's look at Python's input reading method.

>>> name = raw_input("Hey what's your name?\n")
Hey what's your name?
R2D2
>>> print name
R2D2
That's one way of doing it for yourself. However, we don't ask questions in competitive programming, we answer them! We will only use raw_input() to read a string without asking any questions to the system.

Task 
Read a string from the console and print it.

Input Format 
The first and only line of input contains a string.

Constraints 
String length = 500

Output Format 
Print the same string back.

Sample Input

How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
Sample Output

How many chickens does it take to cross the road?
